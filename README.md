# Academic-Information-System-Database-Security

This project implements robust security measures for an Academic Information System (AIS) database to protect sensitive student and lecturer information. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability through encryption, access control, and auditing mechanisms.

## Key Features

### 🔒 Data Protection
- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** for encrypting sensitive data at rest
- **Dynamic Data Masking** to hide sensitive information from unauthorized users
- **Hashing** for secure storage of credentials

### 👮 Permission Management
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict access based on user roles
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for fine-grained data access control

### 📝 Auditing & Compliance
- Comprehensive activity logging for all major database operations
